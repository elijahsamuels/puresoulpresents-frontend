### Need to migrate away from AirTable. Too limiting.


### Use Postgresql database
#### Tables
  Users (has_many instruments, has_many cities, has_many events)
  Instruments (has_many users)
  Events (has_many users)
  Cities (has_many users)

Event has_many Users
A User can be invited to an event (has a user been invited: boolean)
A User can confirm an invitation to an event (0: invited, 1:accpeted, 2: declined)


# TODOS - UserDetails
- taxidName
- userBio
- figure out how to have empty strings be the default value

- create a new user with the default properties of empty strings
- create user in database
- build create user form
- add create user button

- upload image
- userPhoto
- will probably have to use ActiveStorage along with AWS or GCS

# TODOS - Talents (will be used for instruments, but later can be referred to for other skills)
- generate the table
- primary_talent
- secondary_talent
- other_talents (array of other selections)
- 

# TODOS - Cities
- 
- 
- 
- 

# TODOS - Events
-

# PAYROLL
- NOT kendo!
- MUI data-grid
